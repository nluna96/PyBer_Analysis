# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose of the analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Visualizations play a big role because through data visualization the audience absorbs information quickly and facilitates pattern detection. Looking at rows and columns is not the best way to outline trends and pinpoint growth opportunities. That being said visualizing the data makes it easier to outline those trends and pinpoint growth opportunities.

## Results

Ride data by city type shows that there is a big difference between city types. Total Rides in Urban cities by themselves make up about 68.4 percent of all rides. Urban cities have 1625 rides, while Suburban cities have 625 Total Rides and Rural cities have 125 Total Rides. This can be seen in the pie cart below.

#### % Total Rides by City Type

Also, Total Fares from Urban cities are almost twice as much as Total Fares of Rural and Suburban cities if they were combined. Urban cities have a Total Fare of $39,854.38, while Suburban cities have a Total Fare of $19,356.33 and Rural cities have a Total Fare of $4,327.93. Urban cities have more riders and drivers, but Urban cities have lower fares and pay their drivers much less. For example, the Average Fare per Ride in an Urban city is $24.53, while Suburban cities have an Average Fare per Ride of $30.97 and Rural cities have an Average Fare per Ride of $34.62. Also, Urban cities have an Average fare per Driver of $16.57, while Suburban cities have an Average Fare per Driver of $39.50 and Rural cities have an Average Fare per Driver of $55.49. This can be seen in the table below.

#### Ride-Sharing Summary By City Type

In the Total Fare by City Type graph, it can be seen that Urban cities generate more money throughout the year compared to Suburban cities and Rural cities. Also, the lines for city types depicting revenue through January 2019 - April 2019 never intersect with each other. This means that if PyBer wants to introduce a new Urban city it is very likely the new Urban city will generate similar Fare to other Urban cities because Urban Fares are consistent and high. Finally, there is a peak in Fares at the end of February for all three city types.

## Summary
The three business recommendations for the CEO are to maximize Fare from Urban cities, better understand peaks in revenue, and decrease the Rural fare. Urban cities generate the most revenue amongst the three city types. More money should be invested to improve rides for Urban cities so an already high yielding city type generates even more revenue. Also, a deep analysis should be conducted to find out why there was a peak in Fares for all three city type for the end of February. Understanding why these peaks happen can then be leveraged by the CEO to increase overall revenue coming from all three city types. Finally, the CEO should experiment with Fare cost in Rural cities. Currently, Rural cities have the lowest Total Fares amongst the three city types and have the highest Average Fare per Ride. By lowering Fare cost Total Rides and Total Fares may increase for Rural cities.
